## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis. The purpose of this analysis is to automatically classify a loan based on variables of the users financial health.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict. The information specifically was related to debt information about each user.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`). We used the loan size, income, debt to income ratio, and borrower income.
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis. The data preparation of cleaning and normalizing the data. Then the data split by train-test split. Choosing and using the Logistic Regression model. Then oversampling to improve the models performance,
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method). The Logistic Regression model is more simplistic and handles linear data very well.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
